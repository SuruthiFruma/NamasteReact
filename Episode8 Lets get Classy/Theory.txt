Class Components
It is a class in JS that returns a piece of JSX on the render method
 
 1)Major methods of class Components
 ->Constructor() -> Whenever the instance of class is created (Rendered in the DOM), the constructor is called , thats why this is the best place to capture props and establish state
 ->Render() -> The method that returns a JSX as in Functional Components
 ->ComponentDidMount() -> This is similar to useEffect() Hook that is executed after the componenent is rendered in the DOM, displayed in the UI
 ->ComponentDidUpdate
 ->ComponentWillUnmount

 
 2)PROPS
 It is captured in the constructor and can be used in rest of the class from "this"

 3)STATES
 The states are declared in construtor() as one object
 It is again captured in the rest of the class componenent using this keyword

 4)Setting the state
 This is done by the function setState()
 This expects an object with the updated value of the state
 Setting the state triggers the reconciliation process and the render method is called once again

 5)LIFE CYCLE OF CLASS COMPONENTS

 ->MOUNTING -> The first time , constructor and render is called and then UI is updated with DOM and componentDidMount()
 ->UPDATING -> Whenever there is a change in state variable, UPDATING phase triggers and render is called (Constructor() is called once)
 ->UNMOUNTING -> On component removed from DOM

 ->RENDER PHASE -> The phase where constructor() and render() is called
 ->COMMIT PHASE -> The phase where ComponentDidMount() or ComponentDidUpdate() or ComponentWillUnmount() is called

 6)MULTIPLE CHILD CALLING
 When multiple child class componenent is called, the render phase(constructor and render is batched ) of the children and the commit phase (ComponentDidMount() or ComponentDidUpdate() or ComponentWillUnmount()) of the children is called
 This is because the DOM Manipulation is expensive , so rendering in the UI is done at once

 7)STATE variable change
 Whenver there is a change in the state variable, the reconciliation process triggers
 This checks the difference in the object returned by the component(i.e VIRTUAL DOM)
 For functional component, the entire function executes again
 For class component, the render() method is alone again triggered
