--->Started with creating the outline of the food clone app. It involved Header, Body & Footer
Header has title of the app and nav items like Home, About, Contact Us and creating
Body has a search field and the restuarant container which has multiple restaurant cards.
Footer contains copyrights and other information

--->Inline CSS Styling
The style properties can be described in a JS object and can be injected into JSX by passing that object to "style" attribute
Eg:<h2 style={styleObj}></h2>


--->Props
Props are the arguments that is passed into functional components to make the functional component perform dynamically based on the data
Props are always passed to the functional component as object

   ---->To pass a value directly into Props:
<Component value="5"><?Component>
This will create an object like 
let prop={
    value:5
}
Hence this can be destructed in the functional component as let {value}=prop||{} which is equal to prop.value
  
    ---->To pass an already defined value
let number=5
<Component value={number}></Component>
This again, will be of an object
 let prop={
    value=5
}
Hence this can be destructed in the functional component as let {value}=prop||{} which is equal to prop.value

    ----->To pass an object as Props
    let obj={
        name :"Suruthi",
        id:1
    }

<Component value={obj}></Component>
This prop will be an object of the form
let prop={
    value:{
        name:"Suruthi",
        id:1
    }
}
Hence this can be destructed like let {value}=prop followed by let {name,id}=value, which is equivalent to prop.value.name or prop.value.id


--->Config Driven UI
It is practice of dynamic webpage that rely on the data sent by backend
Use Case:Online Food Delivery App. If the backend API sends the discounted attractive prices, it will be displayed in carousels else not

--->Contatenating URL in a JSX 
Explained how to Contatenate string inside a JSX for URL
Eg: <img src={"https://img/"+id}

--->Key Props
The key prop must be given in List while iterating inside a JSX.Or it throws warning
It avoids rerendering of some other components
It is a good practice to avoid indexes as keys as it is not sure that the rerendering will be in a certain order
