8)Async Vs Defer

Downloading the content from the network involves two steps
 --> Fetching from network
 --> Executing the content

 When no attribute is defined in script tag, it causes the HTML parsing wait whenever it encounters the script tag, follows step 1 and 2 and continues the HTML parsing
 When async is used in script tag, Step 1 in done in parallel to HTML Parsing and once step 1 is over, HTML Parsing is stopped and Step 2 is done. After Step 2 is done HTML Parsing is continued
 When defer is used in script tag, Step 1 is done in parallel to HTML Parsing and HTML Parsing completes fully. Atlast the script follows Step 2

 Thus async does not follow order of execution and throws error when used in multiple script tags that are dependent on each other
 It is better to use async keyword for downloading scripts that are independent of the project (Eg: Scripts for Google Analytics)
