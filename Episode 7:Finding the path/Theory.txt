1)Installed React router 6

2)Rendering react root using router
-->createBrowserRouter -> It takes up an array of object with path , element , errorElement and children.
-->The root component that must be rendered must be given a path and element in createBrowserRouter
--> In root.render(), RouterProvider component must be given along with a prop called "router" that takes up the createBrowserRouter object

3)Children routing/Nested routing
-->Children/Nested routing comes into picture when once part of the page needs to intact and the other needs to keep changing

1) <Link> Component must be provided with the prop "to" which takes the actual browsers route
2) <Outlet> Component must be choosen
3) Then configure child routes, in the parent component of the Outlet component, the childroutes must be configured

(The outlet component changes accordingly)

4)Dynamic routing
This is a technique where the routes keep on changing dynamically

1) <Link> component must be given the correct routes to the "to" prop
2) In the path of the routes, the routes must be defined with /: so that it is dynamically
3)In the component , that is rendered on the route , the exact route can be got by a hook called "useParam"
  useParam returns an object that contains the route id given in the path which can be destructed and used

5)useRouteError
This hook returns an object that contains the information about the error routes
We can render a custom error component

6)Created a childroutes for Home, About, Cart, Contact 
Created a restaurant card menu that onclick routes to the particular menu

7)Used swiggy menu API that creates a CORS Error which can overcome with cors disable extension and by passing headers redirect as follow

8)useState
Whenever there is a change in state variable, the whole component rerenders and executes the code in them
Not supposed to declare outside of the functional component as it is a local state variable (Holds good for other hooks as well)
Should be created at the top level of the component
Should not be declared in conditionals, loops 

9)useEffect
With no dependency array, renders everytime
With empty dependency array , renders on init
With a variable, renders on the variable change

10)SSR VS CSR
SSR involves rendering JSP pages from server
CSR takes pages up from routes

11).map() always require a key at the top level of the component

12)anchor tag refreshes the whole component but Link component renders only the specific thing
