1)HOC

A higher order component takes up a component as an input and returns an component as an output
Explained the "Promoted labled restaurant card" for HOC
Explained passing and capturing props using spread operator

2)Built an accordion for restaurant category

-->Built an accordion that opens and closes when clicked(Uncontrolled component)
-->Built an accordion that auto closes the rest of the accordion when clicked(Controlled component & Lifting up the state)

   -->Uncontrolled component: A component that doesnt depend on the parent component purely
   Here, a state variable is declared in AccordionList component that toggles itself to true and false when clicked

   -->Controlled component : The component that depends on the parent component for states and props
   Here, Restaurant Menu (Parent component) has the state variable and the setter function that is passed as props to RestaurantCategory (child)
    
   -->Lifting the state up
   When the child wants to modify/update the state variable of the parent component, it is called as Lifting the state up
   Here, we send true to only to the accordion that is clicked and false to the rest of the accordion
   The state variable in RestaurantMenu(showIndex, setShowIndex) needs to be passed to RestaurantCategory .Later setShowIndex is modified in the child(RestaurantCategory) when clicked
   showAccordion is also passed as a prop to decided if the index and showIndex is same it sets to to true and shows the accordion or else false

Profiler, Flamegraph

4)Context API

-->createContext
-->useContect(to use in functional component) and Consumer(this is to use in class component)
-->Provider(used to modify data and send it to group of component) and then useContext() and fetch the data wherever it is needed
