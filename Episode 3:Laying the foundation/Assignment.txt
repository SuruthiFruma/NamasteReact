1)What is JSX?
JSX comes into picture because in prod level code it is difficult to have React.createElement as its synatax is clumpsy
It is a HTML like or XML like syntax.
It is neither a part of react nor a part of JS
JSX gets converted into React.createElement(). This further in turn converts into the same object returned by React.createElement()
Whereas React.createElement() directly returns an object that can be rendered into the root

2)Script tag's type

Module --> Can be imported and exported
text/Typescript --> Tells browser that it is a Typescript file
text.Babel --> Tells browser that it needs to be transpiled before it goes to the JS Engine
